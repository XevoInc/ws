- Refactor config to be more object-oriented instead of referring to directories
  everywhere. Specifically:
  - A root object, containing a manifest, a list of workspaces, etc.
  - A Workspace object, containing config, projects list, etc.
  This has the benefit of function arguments becoming simpler and avoiding
  fragile dictionary-based lookups, as we could use object properties instead.
